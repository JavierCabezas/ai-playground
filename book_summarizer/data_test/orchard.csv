Focus Area,Question,What to look for in the answer
Scientific Inference,"Given the soil's pH level mentioned, why is Elara convinced the orchard is a ""graveyard""?","The AI should recognize that pH 3.2 is extremely acidic, making traditional plant life impossible."
"The ""How"" (Logic)",Why did Silas pour his water onto Elara’s boots instead of directly onto the ground?,"It should infer that her ""salt-cracked"" or mineral-covered boots acted as a catalyst or bridge to trigger the fungi."
Metaphorical Decoding,"What does Silas mean when he says the trees are just ""oxygen masks""?",It should explain that the visible trees were a temporary front or secondary system for the real organism (the fungi) underneath.
Prediction/Outcome,"What is the significance of the ground ""shivering"" at the end of the story?","The AI should interpret this as the biological system ""waking up"" or reacting aggressively to the moisture/salt."
Character Motivation,"Why did Silas refuse the fortune to live in the ""Steel-Cities""?",It should note his loyalty to a living system that the city-dwellers believe is extinct or irrelevant.
