The Last Orchard

Silas stood at the edge of the salt-cracked earth, holding a single, bruised apple. In the valley below, the "Steel-Cities" hummed with a mechanical drone that never slept. They had offered him a fortune for his land—enough to live in the filtered-air towers for a hundred years—but Silas always pointed to the gnarled roots of the Great Northern tree and stayed silent.

The machines arrived on a Thursday. Not the bulldozers, but the Surveyors. A woman named Elara stepped out of a hovering craft, her boots pristine and white. She looked at the withered trees and then at Silas’s dirt-caked fingernails.

"It’s dead, Silas," she said, her voice amplified by a collar-mic. "The soil acidity is pH 3.2. Nothing has grown here since the Great Desalination. Why hold onto a graveyard?"

Silas didn’t argue the chemistry. He simply took a rusted trowel and dug a shallow hole at her feet. He placed the bruised apple inside and covered it with the grey dust. Then, he did something strange: he poured the last of his canteen—not onto the dirt, but onto Elara’s white boots.

"Water follows the salt," Silas whispered.

Elara looked down, annoyed, until she saw the damp fabric of her boots begin to glow with a faint, bioluminescent green. Deep beneath the "dead" soil, a network of dormant fungi reacted to the moisture. The ground beneath them shivered.

"The trees aren't the orchard," Silas said, stepping back. "They're just the oxygen masks. The orchard is what's waiting for you to stop screaming."
