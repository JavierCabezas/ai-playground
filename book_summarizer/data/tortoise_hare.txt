The Tortoise and the Hare

Once, there was a Hare who bragged about how fast he could run. 
Tired of his boasting, the Tortoise challenged him to a race.

The race began, and the Hare zipped far ahead. Looking back, 
he saw the Tortoise moving very slowly. The Hare felt so 
confident that he decided to take a nap under a tree.

While the Hare slept, the Tortoise kept walking. He never 
stopped, no matter how slow he was. 

When the Hare finally woke up, he ran as fast as he could to 
the finish line. But he was too late. The Tortoise was already 
there, waiting for him.

Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.
